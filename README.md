2.  Choose whether to 'encode' or 'decode' a message.
3.  Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
4.  Enter the shift number.
5.  The program will output the encoded or decoded message.
6.  You can choose to run the program again.

## What I Learned

* Creating functions with parameters.
* Using loops and conditional statements.
* Working with strings and lists.

* Importing ASCII art.

## How to Run

* Make sure you have Python installed.
* Open your terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to the folder where you saved `caesar_cipher.py` and `art.py`.
* Type `python caesar_cipher.py` and press Enter.
